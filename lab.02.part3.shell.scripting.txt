==========


==========
We're going to be writing a shell script. First, though... let's figure out what day and time it is!
==========

==========
1. What day and time is it?

What command did you use, and what was its output?
----------

date
Mon Feb  7 16:19:16 EST 2022




==========
2. Print out a calendar for this month.

What command did you use, and what was its output?
----------


cal

I'm on Windows running GitBash inside VS Code and cal is not a command recognized in this setup. 

==========
3. Go to your home directory. 
Then navigate to your mtec1003-lab-02 folder with a single command. 
Finally, verify that you're in the right place.

What 3 commands did you use to do this?
----------

cd ~
cd mtec1003-lab-02/
pwd

==========
4. Create an empty file called copy_to_backup.sh. 
Verify that the file exists.

What commands did you use to do this?
----------

touch copy_to_backup.sh
ls -l

ls copy* (* is a wildcard character that NARROWS the search space to all files beginning with copy)




==========
5. What are the permissions on your copy_to_backup.sh.

What command did you use to find the permissions?
----------

ls -l

total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 louisgoldford  staff    0 Feb  7 16:31 copy_to_backup.sh
drwxr-xr-x  4 louisgoldford  staff  128 Feb  7 16:01 my_files




==========
6. Change the permissions so that this file is executable by the user.
Verify the new permissions.

What commands did you use to do this?  What was the output?
----------

chmod u+x copy_to_backup.sh
ls -l

total 0
-rwxr--r--  1 louisgoldford  staff    0 Feb  7 16:31 copy_to_backup.sh
drwxr-xr-x  4 louisgoldford  staff  128 Feb  7 16:01 my_files

This command chmod doesn't work on GitBash!! 
FIX: In windows, once a .sh file has the shebang added, it becomes executable automatically!


==========
7. Try executing the file!

$ ./copy_to_backup.sh

What command did you use to try to execute the file? What happens?
----------

./copy_to_backup.sh
nothing happens!




==========
8. Open the file with nano

What command did you use to do this?
----------


We did this together in VS Code! 



==========
9. In your file, write the commands to do the following

a. create a directory called backup 
b. copy all of the txt files in the current directory to the backup directory (use *.txt)
c. print out "I'm done backing up"

Don't forget the first line of your shell script! It should begin with #!/bin/bash)!

Write out the code you typed into your file below...
----------

#!/bin/bash

mkdir backup
cp -r -v *.txt backup
# -r = recursive (go through all files and subfolders that are matched)
# -v = verbose (print details for each file)
echo "I'm done backing up!"


==========
10. Create a directory in your home folder called test
----------

mkdir test

==========
11. Go into that directory and create two empty files... 1.txt and 2.txt

What commands did you use to do this?
----------
cd test
touch 1.txt 2.txt



==========
12. Move the script that you created into this directory.

What commands did you use to do this?
----------

cd ~/Desktop/"My Classes"/mtec1003-lab-02/test
mv copy_to_backup.sh /c/Users/Darks/test
ls -l (to confirm)





==========
13. Run your script.

What commands did you use to do this?
----------

./copy_to_backup.sh


==========
14. Verify that a backup folder was created in your test directory... with copies of the files present.

What commands did you use to do this?  Show the output.
----------
ls (to verify folder)
cd backup
ls -l

total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 Darks 197612 0 Feb  7 17:16 1.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 Darks 197612 0 Feb  7 17:16 2.txt


==========
15. To finish up, using your mouse or with Terminal commands, save this file and be sure it's inside your mtec1003-lab-02 folder. (If not, move it into this folder.)

When finished, be sure to COMMIT your files to your GitHub repository for week 2 labs. Follow the instructions on the Course Website under Week #2...
